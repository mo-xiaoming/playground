Estimation has no value at all.

Estimates are always guesses and are always wrong.

Estimation leads to disjunction, it leads to situations where one works ridiculous hours without needing to.

Excessive or irrational schedules are probably the single most destructive influence in all software. - Caspers Jones, 1991
Simple because people don't have the energy to do good work.

As soon as you have estimates, you have deadline. As soon as you have deadlines, you have people working 16hour a day to meet those deadlines. As soon as you have that, you have a dysfunctional workshop.

If you have to put percentage on estimates to present them, in any kind of truthful way, we have a problem, people don't understand how percentage work, they don't know what those numbers mean. Basically what we're doing here is gambling, I think building business on gambling is a bad idea.


We just don't know how to estimate, and move on.

The real "software crisis" is that many of these projects didn't do anything useful.

Building wrong thing on time and within budget doesn't buy you much

One of another dysfunction comes out of estimate culture, is that we are focusing on time, rather than focusing on programming actually doing. In fact, what the programming is doing is the important thing.

Agile, they try to interpret it in a way that works according to their world view.

Story: your use doing something that delivers valuable result. Or a disguised way of saying function requirements. I'm a use, and I need a menu item to be happy, that's not a story

Story points were invented to obfuscate duration so certain manager would not press the team to estimate - Ron Jeffries

Use a difficulty scale that was not easy to be convertible to time
- Trivial
- Easy
- Normal
- Hard
- Herculean
- Don't know

Velocity is another destructive force in an organization. It is usually misinterpreted as some measure of efficiency

ideal time/actual time
The time between if you have absolutely no abstraction at all, you're doing it 8 hours a day, and you doing nothing but working on it.

The team cannot change it's velocity much. The only thing you can do to improve that number is to change the environment. The reason of velocity goes down is usually the institution put obstacles in the way of work. Those obstacles are stupid forms you have to fill out, stupid stuff you have to do

Nonetheless, in a dysfunctional companies, you'll see managers say, "This team have to improve its velocity", as if teams are made of slackers, sitting there read comics all day. Now they can stop doing that, and to get some work done.

Points per sprint is as oppressive as any time-based deadline

Most backlogs are waste. Estimating backlog items is therefore super waste. Revisiting backlog estimates are in mentally deranged territory -- Paul Klipp

The developers control time, the business side decides what to build. Still an estimate, but moving to the right direction. Nobody orders anybody around. Nobody is forcing you to meet your schedule. Managers keep schedule can be gone.

The role of the "management" is to support the team, take away all obstacles to work, anything the team need, the manager make sure to get that, he is not tell them what to do, he is help them to do what they need to do

Any activities that doesn't directly contribute to putting something of value into customer's hand is waste

All time spend to estimate is a waste, because all that time put to estimate is going to put piece of valuable software into customer's hand

The reason to have projection is to make decisions
1. Shall we kill the project
2. Should add more people

The estimation approach, you don't know you're in trouble until estimates slips so much that obviously you're in trouble, which is much later in project cycle. From business point of view, estimate doesn't help us here, because it doesn't allow us to make these decisions early enough

1. Estimate is waste
2. Estimate is destructive to the organization, the culture that surround supply estimates make the organization work in dysfunctional ways. It forces people to work on overtime, it forces people to work on something that is not important to meet time based timelines.

Building important thing first, then you always have something of value. To do something useful, as fast as possible, and we don't need estimates for that.
