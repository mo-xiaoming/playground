Once you make an estimate, that estimate then converted instantly into a contract or commitment.

When you missed an estimate, then the people that infer that it was a commitment sometime, decide you are not trustworthy and so on and so son.

This breath distrust. Once there is a distrust in the system, you estimate becomes meaningless.

Most estimates are poor, because we misunderstand what estimates are.

There is a fundamental rule in software development, everything takes 3 times longer than you think it should, even you think you this and take it into account.

Estimates should have three characteristics,
1. It's honest, have to communicate bad news when the news is bad. When the appropriate outrage is in your face, you'll be able to continue or to assert the news is bad
2. accurate
3. precise

"I don't know", it's the most honest estimate you can make

Estimate is never a day, it is always a date range. You'll find immense of pressure upon you to make it a date, which you must reject, because you know it's not a date, it's a range of dates. And to be honest, you must continue to say it is a range of dates. Very hard to do, people won't like it.

Most estimates are lies because they are constructed backwards, the end day is already known.

Saying "you have to make a date", doesn't help you to make a date.

Managers are called managers because they have to manage uncertainty. They don't want to manage the risk, they want you to manage the risk.

It's not your job to what your boss likes, it's your job to tell the truth, it's you job to communicate the facts
